Things need to be done/ experimanted with:

1. optimisation to InvertModL() - according to the binary representation of l-2. We can probably use the guys from the dev team to get the best results.
2. create a fuction ScMult() from ScMultAdd(), by removing 'c'. Need to realise if this makes since, optimisation-wise.
3. similar to 2, with point multiplication
4. try to implement projective -> extended points in a more elegant way.
